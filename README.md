# manifest

manifest is a simple go app that I'm developing to get my feet wet in golang.

manifest takes in JSON-formatted manifests. These manifests contain a list of targets that the app will then pull and package together in a format of the user's choosing. Manifest is able to pull from a variety of sources and create a variety of packages.
